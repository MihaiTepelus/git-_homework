I've attended all the classes required so far and I am ready to continue my learning into the ETA 25 Java Programme, Group 2.

2nd Edit:
 - I've passed before some of these tasks, and found it easier now to get through them.
 - At my first attemps, I found it rather difficult, but with practice, you get better and better.
 - Hands-on experience helps in building confidence and skill to work smoother and more productive with git and github options.
 - I have a good feedback to provide: the progress so far has been at a slow and steady pace, the teacher giving us time to get the knowledge learned or remembered to be sinked into our minds and practice skills. Only good things to share so far for the Java Lane, Group 2, of the ETA 25 programme.
